# 	:bicyclist: Prediction demand Bicimad
Final Project  Master in Data Science (KSchool 2021-2022)


## :dart: Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze and predict the hourly demand for Bicimad public service, building an interactive platform to identify demand patterns and predict demand 14 days in advance, by area of madrid (divided by postal code) and globally.

## :memo: Instructions to run the project
First you need to download all the datasets available in the folder of data and save them in the same folder as the jupyter notebooks.
Some datasets are downloaded via a google drive link, due to the size of these files. 
One of them is a zip file, containing one file per month, the file must be unzipped in the same folder as the notebooks and the other files.

All the notebooks are available on the folder Notebooks of the repo. They are:

 1. Exploring and preparing the data -> preparing and converting the raw data into datasets for the models
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis -> analyzing the data created on the first notebook
 3. Models for global demand -> machine learning models to analyze the aggregated demand of the service
 4. Models demand per zones -> machine learning models to analyze the demand per zone of Madrid
